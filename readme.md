Introduction
In the pharmaceutical industry, ensuring the quality and timely production of medicines is crucial. Pharmaverse provides a decentralized solution to this problem by leveraging blockchain technology. It enables the secure tracking of raw materials, quality assessment, batch scheduling, and distribution of medicines, all while maintaining transparency and trust.

## How It Works
Pharmaverse simplifies the medicine production process into the following key steps:

📦 Raw Material Inventory: Raw materials for medicine production are stored and tracked on the blockchain.

🚚 Supplier Interaction: Suppliers receive requests from manufacturers. They check the availability of raw materials and create packages accordingly.

🌐 Transportation: Transporters handle the movement of raw materials between suppliers, manufacturers, and inspectors.

✅ Quality Inspection: Inspectors assess the quality of packages, providing a grade from 1 to 10. A grade of 7 or higher allows the manufacturing process to begin.

📊 Batch Scheduling Algorithm: An algorithm prioritizes which batches to manufacture first based on profitability, generating scores for each batch.

🏭 Manufacturing: The manufacturing process is divided into three stages. After each stage, inspectors check the intermediate product's quality and update its stage if it meets the criteria.

📦 Packaging and Labeling: After manufacturing, medicines are packaged, labeled, and assigned batch IDs.

🚛 Wholesaler Distribution: The final product is transported to wholesalers for distribution.

Features
🔍 Transparency: All transactions and activities are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and traceability.

🧪 Quality Assurance: Inspectors ensure that only high-quality raw materials and intermediate products proceed to the next stage.

📅 Efficient Batch Scheduling: The algorithm optimizes the order in which batches are produced for maximum profitability.

💼 Smart Contracts: Eight smart contracts govern the various stages and interactions in the medicine production process.
